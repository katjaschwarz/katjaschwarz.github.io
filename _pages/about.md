Passionate about generative modeling in 2D and 3D. Ex-Meta AI Researcher. Previously PhD at Autonomous Vision Group in Tübingen.

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and graphics and focuses on 3D vision. In particular, I am
interested in enabeling machines to infer 3D representations from sparse observations, such as 2D images. I am
passionate about leveraging such representations for generative modeling in 2D and 3D.

I worked as a Research Scientist at Meta AI. Prior to this, I did my PhD in
the [Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/)
at [Tübingen University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and
the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/en), advised by [Andreas Geiger](http://cvlibs.net/).
I studied Physics at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) where I received my
bachelor degree in 2016 and master degree in 2018.
