Podcast [Generally Intelligent](https://generallyintelligent.ai/podcast-episode-5-katja-schwarz.html) by Kanjun Qiu and
Josh Albrecht. We cover the role 3D generation plays in conceptual understanding, continuous functions as
representations for 3D objects and tons of practical tips on GAN training.
